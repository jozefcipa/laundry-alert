# Laundry Alert

> _A small IoT project that monitors your washing machine and sends a push notification when the washing cycle ends_

## How it works

![Diagram](./assets/diagram.png)

The application consists of three parts

**iOS Web App**

A simple web application that is used to subscribe for notifications. It is installed on a phone as a web app.

Deployed at [laundry.iot.jozefcipa.com](https://laundry.iot.jozefcipa.com/).

See the [docs](./src/web/README.md).

**OrangePi**

This is where the main logic resides. It is an [OrangePi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-Zero.html
) single-board computer running the Node.js app that communicates with the A/D converter, controls the status LED and sends push notifications to the web app.

Deployed at local network IP (e.g. `192.168.0.100:80`) behind the NGINX proxy.

See the [docs](./src/api/README.md).

**Seeduino (A/D converter)**

[Seeeduino XIAO SAMD21](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html) is used here to perform a simple analog to digital conversion when reading the values from the photoresistor. This data is then processed by the Control unit.


See the [docs](./src/ad-converter/README.md).


## Running locally
- Install dependencies - `make deps`
- Start the web - `make web`
- Start the API - `make api/dev` (**Note**: the API must be [configured first](./src/api/README.md))
- Deploy the code to Seeduino (via Arduino IDE)

### Makefile
- `deps` - Download production + develeopment NPM dependencies
- `deps/prod` - Download production NPM dependencies
- `api/prod` - Start the API with `NODE_ENV=production`
- `api/register-launcher` - Register pm2 startup launcher so the API will start automaticall after reboot
- `api/dev` - Run API locally
- `api/init-db` - Initialize SQLite database
- `web` - Serve web client application locally
- `deploy` - Copy the files from the local computer to OrangePi
- `ssl/certificate-manager` - Saves the next SSL certificate renewal date and generates the certificate if needed
- `nginx/setup` - Configure NGINX server (needs to be ran with `sudo`)
- `gpio/test` - Test whether GPIO works by blinking the LED

## Configuration

### OrangePi Configuration

#### Connecting to the unit
You can connect to OrangePi via SSH (password `orangepi`)

```bash
$ ssh orangepi@192.168.0.100
```

#### Prerequisites

Make sure to have `mkcert` [downloaded](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) locally on your computer and generate the root CA authority first! (`mkcert -install`)

#### Installation

- Install Node.js
- Install Nginx
- Install [WiringOP](https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/wiringOP) GPIO library
- Generate VAPID keys (See [API configuration](./src/api/README.md))
- Copy code from the computer - `make deploy`
- Install NPM dependencies (`sudo make deps/prod`, use `sudo` in order to install `pm2` globally). It might take a while, just be patient ðŸ˜…
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `./api/src` and configure the values
- Initialize the database - `make api/init-db`
- Start the API - `make api/prod`
- Register the API to start after booting - `make api/register-launcher`
  - **Run** the command provided in the output
- Generate SSL certificates - `make ssl/certificate-manager`
- Run `cat .crontab | crontab -` to make sure `ssl/certificate-manager` is ran automatically after reboot
- Configure Nginx - `sudo make nginx/setup`
- Open `192.168.0.100` in your browser. If everything went well you should see a response from the API.

#### GPIO
GPIO stands for General Purpose Input Output bus and it's used to communicate with other devices.<br>
This project uses two pins - one for controlling the LED (16) and one for reading information from the A/D converter (6).

**Note**: Use the `wPi` column (`$ gpio readall`) to refer to the correct pin number!

We can test whether the library is installed and working properly by trying to turn the LED on and off.

```bash
$ gpio readall       # show the GPIO configuration map
$ gpio mode 16 out   # set the GPIO pin 16 (LED) as OUTPUT
$ gpio write 16 1    # turn on the LED
$ gpio write 16 0    # turn off the LED
```

There is also a Makefile command `make gpio/test` that does the same.

### Running on the microcomputer
- `(local-computer)$ make deploy` - Deploy the code
- connect to OrangePi
- `(orange-pi)$ make api/prod` - Start the program manually

### HTTPS and iOS

As the app is using self-managed SSL certificate for the API, we need to register it in our iOS (Android) device in order to allow connections. <br>
In order to do so, we need to add the SSL root authority certificate into our phone. <br>
Read more [here](https://jozefcipa.com/blog/self-signed-ssl-certificates-on-ios) to see how to configure it.
